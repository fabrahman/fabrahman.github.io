<!-- the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the -->
I am currently a research scientist at [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) (Ai2). Prior to that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) and [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). I did my Ph.D. (2022) in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz, working with [Snigdha Chaturvedi](https://sites.google.com/site/snigdhac/). I hold a master degree (2018) in Computer Science and a master (2014) and bachelor (2012) degree in Electrical Engineering. I have a broad set of research interests:

- **Understanding language model's capabilities and limitations** in the wild under **unseen or changing situations** and **developing efficient algorithms** to address these limitations beyond just scaling. This includes better design for collaborative strategies and HCI interfaces to combine the best of Human and AI abilities.
- **Investigating LLM behaviors as a function of training data and alignment strategies** to build **Human-centered** AI system that are more **reliable and safe** across various contexts.
- Developing robust and meaningful **evaluation frameworks** to investigate the **emergent bahaviors of LLMs** that are challenging to measure.

<!-- I am broadly interested in **understanding language model's capabilities and limitations** in **reasoning** tasks and **developing efficient algorithms** to address these limitations beyond scaling. More recently, I started caring about building **Human-centered** AI system that are more **reliable and safe** to use in various contexts. I am also excited about **inference-time algorithms** and **alignment** in general. Please feel free to get in touch if you want to chat, collaborate or brainstorm! -->
<!-- Below are several themes I am interested in: -->


<!-- I am broadly interested in natural language understanding and generation with the long-term goal of instilling human-like communication, and reasoning capabilities in machines. My current research interests include (controllable) text generation, (social) commonsense reasoning, and unsupervised learning. -->

Previously, I interned at Microsoft Research, working on controllable grounded text generation; and at Ai2, working on unsupervised rationale generation for non-monotonic reasoning. My work has been featured in press by [GreekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2024/ai2s-new-tulu-3-model-rivals-tech-giants-in-breakthrough-for-open-source-ai-post-training/) and [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/21/ai2s-open-source-tulu-3-lets-anyone-play-the-ai-post-training-game/?guccounter=1).

Feel free to get in touch if you want to chat, collaborate or brainstorm!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
